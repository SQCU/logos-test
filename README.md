# LOGOS-TEST  
# goals  
hello worlds are so very important because they mark the first complete action in the history of a project.    
the 'hello world' for procedural animation must be the most basic kinematic routine which could not be convincingly  
faked by extensive manual labor or inextensible hardcodes.  
I would consider an object orbiting another while revolving on its own axis to be the simplest qualifying routine.

logos-test set out to:  
Write an animation routine featuring rotation about 2 axes at once.  
Animate with requestAnimationFrame to allow arbitrary display update intervals, allowing smooth animation at 120hz+ across all platforms.  
Write platform-independent routines for consistent performance across all platforms (phones, PC format browsers).  
# timeline
logos-test was mashed out in a single day of effort on 11/30/2020!  
huge thanks to "zazooples" of notorious esports gaming society "NTR - Never Touch a Raccoon" for the CSS canvas scaling tweak.  
huge thanks to Joshua Li for ‘58 bytes of css’.
an error-by-error breakdown of logos-test's debugging can be found at https://sqcu.github.io/posts/logos-test/ .
# results
the first SQCU autopedagogy project, typesetter-toy paid huge dividends, allowing the easy import of all the HTML5 canvas kludge-boilerplate.  
logos-test covered all scoped features within hours, not days!  
logos-test felt qualitatively good.  
logos-test proved that updating a self-hosted static site can take less than 5 minutes, and cause service interruptions of a couple of seconds.  
# instructions for use
like all of the early-SQCU autopedagogies circa 2020, running logos-test is easy!
